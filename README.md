Roblox-Group-Management-API

> A powerful, security-focused, and stealthy Roblox Group Management API written in Python.
Runs a local web server that wraps complex Roblox group operations into simple, secure RESTful API endpoints, allowing easy automation of your group's administration.



The core design philosophy of this project is ‚ÄúParanoid Masquerade Mode‚Äù, which aims to minimize the risk of detection by Roblox's anti-bot systems by deeply emulating the behavior of a real human user browsing the site.

üöÄ Core Features: Why This is Different

Feature	This Project (Paranoid Mode)	Traditional / Simple Scripts

Browser Simulation	‚úÖ High-Fidelity Mimicry: Rotates browser identities & sends matching sec-ch-ua headers.	‚ùå Basic or None: Static User-Agent, easy to fingerprint.
Session Management	‚úÖ Smart Keep-Alive: Refreshes CSRF and session by simulating harmless activity.	‚ùå Passive: Cookies & tokens expire quickly.
Request Protocol	‚úÖ Modern HTTP/2: Uses httpx to match modern browser behavior.	‚ùå Outdated HTTP/1.1.
Behavioral Pattern	‚úÖ Human-like Pacing: Randomized delays to mimic human reaction times.	‚ùå Instantaneous requests at machine speed.
Risk Profile	üîí Low Risk	‚ö†Ô∏è High Risk

üîó How to Use the API

Get Your API Key

The first run will print your API key and save it in api_key.txt.

‚úÖ Add your API key via:

Header:
x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY

Or Query Param:
?api_key=YOUR_API_KEY


Interactive Docs

Open http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs for a full Swagger UI to test endpoints.

Example: Get Group Info

curl -X GET "http://127.0.0.1:8000/groups/1234567" \
     -H "x-api-key: your_api_key_here"

üîí Security Considerations

‚úÖ API Key Protection: All endpoints require the key.
‚úÖ Local Execution: Credentials stay on your machine.
‚ö†Ô∏è Evasion: No method is 100% foolproof against detection.
